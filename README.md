# Simple-NumPy-tutorial-using-the-Iris-Dataset
This a simply numpy tutorial covering the basic implementation with the public iris dataset.


# Numpy and Pandas Basics

This repository contains Python code snippets demonstrating fundamental concepts of NumPy and Pandas. These libraries are widely used for numerical and data manipulation tasks in the field of data science.

## NumPy Highlights:

- Creating 1D and 2D arrays
- Generating random arrays
- Basic array operations (slicing, arithmetic, matrix multiplication)
- Comparison and logical operations
- Universal functions and aggregation
- Sorting and manipulation
- Array splitting, concatenation, and broadcasting

## Pandas Highlights:

- Loading data with Pandas
- Basic DataFrame operations
- Accessing and manipulating DataFrame elements
- Arithmetic operations with DataFrames
- Boolean indexing and filtering
- Statistical operations on DataFrames

## Usage:

1. Each code snippet is provided in Python files.
2. Run the files individually to see the output and understand the concepts.
3. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different scenarios.

## Dependencies:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for loading the Iris dataset)

Feel free to explore and learn from the code! If you have any questions or suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy coding!
